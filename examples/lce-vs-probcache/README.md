# Compare LCE and ProbCache strategies

This example compares LCE and ProbCache strategies using a sample RocketFuel topology.

## Run
To run the experiments, execute:

    $ make

## How does it work
The `config.py` contains all the configuration for executing experiments and
do plots. The `Makefile` script launches the Icarus simulator passing the configuration
file as an argument.
